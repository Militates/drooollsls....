# Hello. Get to know me.
Hi I'm Outlaw/Tenko or Xovexzi (sometimes) (Dont call me Xovosi I am not Notive I repeat I am not Notive)

He/Him strictly. If you do not know my pronouns please ask me so you can use He/Him.

I really love camo and all those sorts, I think its really NEET (pun intended). I also like robots.

I like electric dreams, doodle world, die of death, beat the robloxian, blood debt and IPS2. (and also countryballs. But only sometimes.)

●  Please use /j tonetag if your joke is targeted towards me

●  Dark humor is okay for me. Talk freely, I don't care. You only live once anyway.

●  I tend to be really awkward when you're talking to me privately unless you talk a lot so sorry about that

●  I have social anxiety and its hard for me to approach people to talk

●  I talk about offensive topics at times so watch out if you're thinking about being friends with me. If you're not comfortable, tell me and I'll stop (I'll stop talking about those things AROUND YOU). If you can't stand it in general, leave me

● And lastly, I do not have a DNI list. You can be as open as you want, since mayhaps I may just be as bad as you are.
